Introduction
PatchSTG is an attention-based dynamic spatial modeling method that uses irregular spatial patching for efficient large-scale traffic forecasting. Notably, we show that spatiotemporal graphs can be patched on the spatial dimension, effectively reducing complexity in attention.



PatchSTG comprises four components: (1) embedding the input traffic into high-dimensional representations with spatio-temporal properties, (2) segmenting the large-scale input into balanced and non-overlapped patches on the spatial dimension with irregularly distributed points, (3) using depth and breadth attentions on the patched input to capture local and global spatial dependencies efficiently, and (4) projecting representations to the predicted future traffic.

Datasets
You can access the well pre-processed datasets from [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1a3R5rFST4O0Ohr4QCXhsIKkezWLriE-K], then place the downloaded contents under the correspond dataset folder such as ./data/SD.

PreTrained Weights
You can access the pretrained weights from [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1NJW-fJgrN8o-9VTsSrEzER150X3EFGPG], then place the downloaded contents under the constructed cpt folder ./cpt.

Quick Demos
Download datasets and place them under ./data
We provide pre-trained weights of results in the paper and the detail configurations under the folder ./config. For example, you can test the SD dataset by:
python main.py --config ./config/SD.conf
If you want to train the model yourself, you can use the code at line 262 of the main file.
